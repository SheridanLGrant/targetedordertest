# targetedordertest

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Targeted tests for orderings seek to reject the null hypothesis of uniform randomness, drawing statistical power from a "targeted" alternative hypothesis that specifies the type of non-randomness expected in the orderings. The Linear Concordance and Rank Compatibility tests of [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378375818300867](Grant, Perlman, and Grant, 2020) are implemented in this package.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of targetedordertest from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("targetedordertest") -->
<!-- ``` -->

Until this package is accepted into CRAN, you can install it with `install_github(SheridanLGrant/targetedordertest)`.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(targetedordertest)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots.
